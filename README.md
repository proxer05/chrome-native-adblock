# Chrome Native Adblock v1.0.5

High-performance 100% RAM-only native ad filtering and Manifest V2 enabler for
stock Google Chrome on Windows.

Chrome Native Adblock injects a native adblock engine directly into Chrome's
Network Service process in memory, validates build-specific PE rules, and provides
a modern Windows 11 WinUI 3 desktop dashboard.

## What it does

- Evaluates EasyList/ABP-style network and cosmetic rules through
  [`adblock-rust`](https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust).
- Injects the network engine into Chrome's Network Service without modifying
  the signed `chrome.dll` file.
- Generates cosmetic/scriptlet payloads from the exact URL of each tab. Rules
  for YouTube or Vietnamese news sites are not injected into unrelated sites.
- Downloads filter subscriptions with a 64 MiB limit, validates that they
  contain rules, and atomically replaces the last-known-good cache.
- Uses an ephemeral loopback DevTools port tied to the dedicated
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ChromeNativeAdblock\Profile` profile.
- Can optionally enable Manifest V2 using the semantic RAM patch from
  [chrome-enable-mv2](https://github.com/onlytrisdev/chrome-enable-mv2).

No Chrome sandbox or code-integrity mitigation is disabled except the
network-service sandbox feature, which the native hook requires on Chrome 155+
(see the security model below). No telemetry is
collected by this project.

## Compatibility

The native network hook supports **Chrome 155.0.8048.0 x64 (Dev)**,
**Chrome 153.0.8010.37 x64**, **Chrome 152.0.7977.65 x64** and
**Chrome 152.0.7977.76 x64**. Function RVAs, prologues, and `URLRequest`/`GURL`
layouts are recorded per build under `native/hook_rules/` and verified before
installation.

Every other Chrome layout is rejected before a hook is installed. Do not copy
RVAs or object offsets between Chrome builds.

The current low-level hook sees the final URL but not complete request metadata,
so it evaluates requests as resource type `other`, method `GET`, with the request
URL as its source URL. Generic blocking and exception rules work; type-only or
initiator-dependent rules such as `$script`, `$image`, `$xhr`, or `$third-party`
are not yet fully represented by the native hook.

YouTube blocking is best-effort and can change when YouTube changes its player.
Subscription scriptlets are deliberately not executed in YouTube's page context
because response-pruning scriptlets can trigger its anti-adblock dialog; network
rules, cosmetic filtering, visible skip controls, and bounded short-ad acceleration
remain active.
The batch smoke test reports `INCONCLUSIVE` when the player, playback progress,
or seek evidence cannot be verified; it does not count those cases as passes.

## Download

Download `ChromeNativeAdblock-GUI-v1.0.5-win-x64.zip` from
[Releases](https://github.com/onlytrisdev/chrome-native-adblock/releases), extract
the archive, and run `ChromeNativeAdblock.Gui.exe`.

The GUI and CLI use a separate Chrome profile by default. Existing bookmarks,
cookies, and extensions from the normal Chrome profile are intentionally not
copied. To browse with your existing logins, the GUI has a profile selector
(dedicated profile vs. your original Chrome profile) and the CLI accepts
Chrome's standard `--user-data-dir=...` argument. Note that Chrome 136+
blocks remote debugging on a channel's default user data directory, so
cosmetic filtering and the live console only run with the dedicated profile
(or a copy of your profile placed at a non-default path).

## Build and test

Requirements: Windows x64, Rust stable, .NET 10 SDK, and the Windows App SDK
workload required by the WinUI project.

```powershell
cargo test --workspace
cargo build --workspace --release
dotnet test .\ChromeNativeAdblock.slnx -c Release --filter "Category!=Integration"
dotnet build .\ChromeNativeAdblock.slnx -c Release
```

Chrome-dependent validation on a machine with the supported Chrome build:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\launcher\ChromeNativeAdblock.Launcher -c Release -- analyze-mv2
dotnet run --project .\launcher\ChromeNativeAdblock.Launcher -c Release -- engine-smoke
dotnet run --project .\launcher\ChromeNativeAdblock.Launcher -c Release -- cosmetic-smoke
dotnet run --project .\launcher\ChromeNativeAdblock.Launcher -c Release -- network-smoke
```

Create release archives:

```powershell
.\scripts\package-release.ps1 -Version v1.0.0
```

## Security model

- Unknown hook layouts fail closed.
- Hook targets must reside in executable `.text` and match verified prefixes.
- `chrome.dll` and other Chrome installation files are never changed on disk.
- When the native network hook is enabled on Chrome 155+ (where Chrome enables
  the network-service sandbox on some builds), the launcher passes
  `--disable-features=NetworkServiceSandbox`. A sandboxed Network Service
  applies a non-Microsoft-signed DLL block and a dynamic-code prohibition that
  make any MinHook-based engine impossible to install, and Chrome provides no
  switch that lifts only those mitigations for sandboxed children. All other
  Chrome sandboxing (renderers, GPU, utility processes, ...) stays fully
  enabled. The launcher also grants Chrome's per-channel network-sandbox
  capability and ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES read/execute access on the engine
  files so the engine keeps loading on builds where the sandbox stays on
  without the hook (MV2-only mode).
- CDP discovery trusts only a fresh `DevToolsActivePort` from the managed
  profile; it does not fall back to another Chrome profile or port 9222.
- Filter downloads are HTTPS subscription URLs controlled by their respective
  maintainers. See [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
